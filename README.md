## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/eenvo.git
   cd eenvo
   ```

2. **Set environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

   ```env
   DEVEXTREME_KEY=your_devextreme_key_here
   POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
   POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASS=your_secure_password
   ```

   - `DEVEXTREME_KEY`: Required for the web UI to function. Obtain from DevExtreme.
   - `POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL`: Email for the PocketBase admin user.
   - `POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASS`: Password for the PocketBase admin user.

3. **Start the services:**

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   - The web UI will be available at [http://localhost](http://localhost)
   - The API (PocketBase) will be available at [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)

4. **Login:**
   - Use the admin email and password you set in the `.env` file to log in as the administrator.

## Docker Compose Variables

- `DEVEXTREME_KEY`: License key for DevExtreme (required for UI components).

## Advanced: Running with supervisord

To use supervisord:

1. Ensure `supervisord` is installed in your environment.
2. Edit `supervisord.conf` as needed.
3. Start supervisord:

   ```sh
   supervisord -c supervisord.conf
   ```
